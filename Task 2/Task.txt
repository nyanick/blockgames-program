Create a “Hello World” contract with a constructor, at least two functions, and a state variable, and Deploy to a Testnet (Rinkeby).

 

Prerequisite:

Basic Solidity syntax.
Testnets
 

Objectives:

To expose students to smart contracts on Ethereum via Solidity. 
To expose students to basic deployment patterns.
Submission:

Push your code to GitHub ( Solidity contract, BIN, and ABI)
Deploy your contract on an Ethereum Testnet.
Add the successfully deployed contract's address to your GitHub README.md.
Verify your contract's source code
Submit a link to GitHub repo/folder containing code (Ensure it's publicly available)
